### Sensing Subsystem (Boikanyo Ntsimane):

The goal of the sensing subsystem is to enable for micro-mouse wall detection and indication of the presence or absence of walls via LEDs. 

This branch contains documentation related to the sensing subsystem, including the PCB Gerber Files and schematic.

### Power Subsystem (Karen Karenyi): 

This branch contains documentation related to the power subsystem, including the PCB Gerber Files and schematic.
